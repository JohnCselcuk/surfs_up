- Flask application
- Matplotlib
- SQLite and SQLAlchemy
- Pandas and Numpy

## Overview of Analysis
The goal of this analysis is, Fictional company Waves and Ice Cream wants to determine if opening a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii has good business value. Temperature data for the months of June and December were analyzed to assist in determining if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

### June Temperature Analysis
Based on the analysis, we can see that there are 1,700 observations for the months of June. This includes the years between 2010 and 2017. The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures are listed below. The low standard deviation implies a relatively small spread across the temperature observations. This makes sense, as Oahu weather does not seem to fluctuate significantly.
